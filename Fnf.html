    <p>Friday Night Funkin’ (𝓕𝓝𝓕) is a popular rhythm game created by a small team of indie developers. The main character of the game is Boyfriend, who must win musical battles to prove his skills and protect his relationship with Girlfriend. Each week in the game features new opponents, songs, and challenges.</p>
    <p>The gameplay is simple but exciting: players must press the correct arrows in time with the music. The more accurate the player is, the better the score. If the player misses too many notes, they lose the battle.</p>
    <p>One of the reasons FNF became very popular is its catchy music and unique art style. The game community also creates thousands of mods, adding new characters, songs, and stories. Many of these mods have become almost as famous as the original game.</p>
    <p>Overall, Friday Night Funkin’ is a fun and creative rhythm game that continues to grow thanks to its active community and memorable soundtrack.</p>

    <p>There are many mods in this game, and the community creates more every day. However, I will talk about one of the most famous mods — Garcello.</p>
    <p>The Garcello mod is a popular Friday Night Funkin’ mod created by ATSUover. It introduces a new character named Garcello, a calm and mysterious smoker who challenges Boyfriend to a rap battle. The mod includes four original songs: Headache, Nerves, Release, and Fading. Each song becomes more emotional as the story goes on, and Garcello slowly fades away due to the smoke surrounding him.</p>
    <p>This mod is loved for its music, animations, and emotional story, making it one of the most memorable mods in the FNF community.</p>
